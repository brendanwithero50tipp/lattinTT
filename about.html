           <p>

            Lattin is surrounded by rich pasture land, most of which is used for dairy farming. It is situated in an area of south Tipperary known as the Golden Vale, an area in which the land is particularly suitable for grass growing and dairy farming. In a sporting context, Lattin has a thriving GAA Club, known as Lattin-Cullen which is affiliated to the West Division Board of Tipperary GAA. The Club is known historically for its senior football team which has been among the most successful in the region during the last 50 years. Ironically, its best known player in the same period is Nicholas English of Cullen village who has been one of the great names of inter-county hurling in the last 30 years.
